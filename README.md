# Cipher by Stella Huayhuaca

## Epicodus Drupal, week 2.

#### Create our own custom module in Drupal 7 using Forms, Validation and PHP code.

### Requires previous installation of:
  * Git (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  * MAMP (https://www.mamp.info/) to host the Website and MySQL Database
  * Drupal 7.54 (https://www.drupal.org/)

### Requirements for the custom module:
  * Use validated text input fields:
    * Field 1: allows any positive number.
    * Field 2: allows "left" or "right"
    * Field 3: allows only use of letters, spaces and punctuation
    * the output after submitting the form should be the encoded message, all in lowercase.


### Installation:
  * git clone this repo on your desktop
  * This cloned folder is `site` folder
  * The password for Database, database user, site administrator and are `cipher`.
  * Site database is in sites/db-backup/ and has to be imported into MAMP by opening `localhost:8888/phpmyadmin/`
  * Set MAMP's Host Document Root folder to site folder Cipher.
  * Launch site by opening `localhost:8888/`
